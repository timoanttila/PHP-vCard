# PHP-vCard

Virtual Contact File, also known as vCard, is a file format standard for electronic business cards. They can contain name and address information, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, URLs, logos, photographs, and audio clips.

I originally created this code for the ProcessWire theme, but it can be used in any PHP project. The vCard link is created from the person's information and sent as a GET request to the receiving page. The browser downloads the result to the visitor.
